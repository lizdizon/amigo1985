Amigo 1985 WordPress Theme - a tribute to Amiga Workbench 1.x

This WordPress theme started as one of my school projects in 2011, and I wanted to share it.

features
--------

* Makes your WordPress installation look like Amiga Workbench 1.x
* Widget support

quick install
-------------

1. [Download the amigo1985 project as a .zip](https://github.com/lizdizon/amigo1985/archive/master.zip) and unarchive it into the `/wp-content/themes/` directory of your WordPress installation.
  * You can delete the .psd files in `/images/` before uploading the theme to your server in order to save upload time and drive space. They are only there in case you needed to modify the theme images.
  * Optionally, rename the new theme's directory to `amigo1985`.
2. Activate the theme from your WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Themes.

known issues
------------

* Terse documentation: I'm currently attending university and do not have all the time I want for all my projects, so I've put this Amiga theme on GitHub for all the fans who have encouraged me to do so (thank you for the moral support!).
* **Please post theme issues in the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/lizdizon/amigo1985/issues), and I welcome anyone to contribute to the project and make it a better theme!**

dev caveat
-----------
* The theme uses the [960 grid system](http://960.gs/) (it was part of the original project spec), so you'll want to familiarize yourself with that if you're going to be hacking divs.
